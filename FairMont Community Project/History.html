<!-- Intro to History -->
<font size="+6">History of the Fairmont Community</font>
<p><font size="+3">Fairmont is a small, urban, unicorporated neighborhood
located between Lockport and Joliet in Will County, Illinois. The region where
Fairmont was initially settled can be dated back far to the 1870's, with the population
during that time consisting of Eastern European and Irish immigrants who moved to
Illinois to work on the Illinois & Michigan Canal, the Rock Island Railroad, and the
Illinois Ship and Sanitary Canal. By the 1950's, Fairmont grew into a stable neighborhood,
mainly due to the large influx of African Americans moving to northern states after WW2.<br><br>

Currently, Fairmont facing a change to its population, with a growing number of Hispanic residents
moving into the neighborhood. A neighborhood plan called the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning
(CMAP) is currently in effect to help the future of Fairmont grow into a stronger tomorrow. Detailed below
is the history of how this strong neighborhood grew into a great community.
